As a Systems Analyst, I developed an excel application for test purposes which was able to be called by the new application being build thereby saving my client thousands of dollars in development costs.
As a Certified Scrum Master (CSM) was able to improve my team's story completion percentage from 42% to 80%.
As a Release Train Engineer (RTE) certifed in SAFe 6.0, I trained and implemented the SAFe methodology to my department of over 140 people.
As a SM I represent ISO9001 audits for my group multiple times and passed both Internal and External Audits for my company.
